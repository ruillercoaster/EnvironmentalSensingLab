We are maintaining a gridding code for satellite soundings. One available application is gridded TROPOMI SIF (instantaneous, day-length corrected, and relative SIF). 

Feel free to contact Dr. Cheng if you are interested in getting gridded products. If we feel that we should be offered participation as authors, we will let you know and we assume that an agreement on such matters will be reached prior to publishing the data.
